You’ve likely heard the saying “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing, and expecting different results.” Humans have an intuitive sense of what scientists call attractor states, the concept that systems tend to revert to the same patterns unless external factors change. We’ve captured this intuition in all sorts of sayings:

“History repeats itself.”

“You reap what you sow.”

“If nothing changes, nothing changes.”

“Don’t expect new flowers if you keep planting the same seeds.”

Our intuition for attractor states is complicated by the fact that we are narrative-producing creatures. When it comes to asking what to reap, what to change, or what new seeds to sow, we jump to convenient, coherent-to-us answers. Nassim Taleb coined the term’ narrative fallacy’ to describe our tendency to weave neat causal stories after the fact, but the concept is well-worn.

Plato went further, suggesting that we crave what he called a “noble lie” (gennaion pseudos): a story so sweeping and coherent that it can hold a society together, even if it distorts reality. Anyone who has lived through company layoffs and the ensuing narrative spinning can relate.

Our intuitive sense that the present is “held in place” by certain factors must be balanced against our tendency to frame narratives around those factors. On the one hand, we sense, “We’re stuck and need something to change.” On the other hand, we reach for neat stories like, “We just need to hire someone who’s done this before” or “We just need to visualize the work and reduce work in progress!”

Companies pour billions into these narratively pleasing solutions, only to end up back where they started, this time with added skepticism and weariness. Granted that may not be a problem for the people who make those decisions (picking the safe, narratively persuasive option is a wise career move, and scapegoating is a time-honored political tradition). Still, the outcome leaves a lot to be desired.

Why is this important?

Many systems and complexity-informed thinkers become bogged down in selling complexity, uncertainty, systems thinking, and the like. Meanwhile, most people in an organization are looking for a solution and path forward, not a lecture about “the system”. They rightfully see outcomes as a result of collection actions and behaviors, so they are really wondering what you should do, not necessarily think.

They also want to be a co-author of the solution and the narrative.

“OK, you with all of your theories, what CAN we do here?” “What are you proposing?” “What will it look like?” “Why is this the right choice?” “And what is the story behind that? What’s the narrative?”

Or put another way:

We have an intuitive sense of attractor states.

We sense that something must change.

We create a simplified narrative when deciding what to change. It’s hard, but you can short-circuit this in yourself and others.

But whatever you dream up has to fill the same void:

For a narrative

For a connection between action and effect

A basic example.

I was chatting with a leader recently who was feeling a lot of pressure to take bold steps to make her team “more predictable”. Her manager was hinting that they expected her to lay off some people. But something felt off. She didn’t really think individual changes would make a big difference. She could imagine the same issues creeping back again and again, regardless of who was involved. However, she struggled to explain this to her manager, who was caught in a form of narrative fallacy (they were both relatively new, and seemed eager to spin a story involving old hiring habits). It sounded too theoretical.

In practice, she wasn’t going to win by challenging her manager’s narrative head-on. To her boss, she framed it simply: “We’re putting in place practices that will make risks visible earlier and commitments more reliable. I’ll hold myself accountable by checking in on these measures every two weeks.”

And then she worked with her team to shift the narrative around what “predictability” really meant. Together, they created a shared language that made it safe to escalate risks early, rather than absorbing them. She also began exploring with her engineering counterparts the hidden incentives that pushed engineers to overfill their plates.

This reframing achieved two things simultaneously: it provided her manager with a story they could support (”the team is building stronger habits for predictability”), while also creating space within the team to experiment with more complexity-aware practices. It wasn’t about rejecting the narrative fallacy outright, but about co-authoring a better story.

Đây là một bài rất hay về tư duy hệ thống và cách quản lý thay đổi trong tổ chức! Tôi sẽ dịch và giải thích cho bạn:

## 📖 **DỊCH VÀ GIẢI THÍCH**

### **Tiêu đề: "Nhưng Chúng Ta Phải Thử Điều Gì Đó!"**

**Đoạn mở đầu:**

> Bạn có thể đã nghe câu nói "Định nghĩa của sự điên rồ là làm cùng một việc mà mong đợi kết quả khác biệt." Con người có trực giác về cái mà các nhà khoa học gọi là "trạng thái hút" (attractor states) - khái niệm rằng các hệ thống có xu hướng quay về những mẫu hình giống nhau trừ khi có yếu tố bên ngoài thay đổi.

**Các câu tục ngữ minh họa:**

- "Lịch sử lặp lại chính nó"
- "Gieo gì gặt đó"
- "Nếu không gì thay đổi thì không gì thay đổi"
- "Đừng mong hoa mới nếu bạn cứ gieo cùng những hạt giống cũ"

---

### **🧠 KHÁI NIỆM CHÍNH:**

**1. Narrative Fallacy (Sai lầm tường thuật):**

> Nassim Taleb đặt ra thuật ngữ này để mô tả xu hướng của chúng ta tạo ra những câu chuyện nhân quả gọn gàng sau khi sự việc đã xảy ra.

**Ví dụ thực tế:** Khi công ty sa thải nhân viên, ban lãnh đạo sẽ tạo ra câu chuyện "hợp lý" để giải thích quyết định.

**2. Noble Lie (Lời nói dối cao cả):**

> Plato gọi đây là câu chuyện quá rộng lớn và mạch lạc đến mức có thể gắn kết cả xã hội, ngay cả khi nó bóp méo thực tế.

---

### **🎯 VẤN ĐỀ CHÍNH:**

**Nghịch lý của tổ chức:**

- **Một mặt:** Chúng ta cảm nhận "Chúng ta đang bị mắc kẹt và cần thay đổi gì đó"
- **Mặt khác:** Chúng ta tìm đến những câu chuyện đơn giản như:
  - "Chúng ta chỉ cần thuê người đã làm việc này trước đây"
  - "Chúng ta chỉ cần trực quan hóa công việc và giảm work in progress!"

**Kết quả:** Công ty đổ hàng tỷ đô vào những giải pháp "nghe hay" này, chỉ để cuối cùng quay về chỗ cũ, lần này còn thêm hoài nghi và mệt mỏi.

---

### **💡 CASE STUDY THỰC TẾ:**

**Tình huống:**
Một leader nữ đang bị áp lực phải thực hiện những bước "táo bạo" để làm cho team "dự đoán được hơn". Sếp gợi ý sa thải một số người.

**Vấn đề:**
Cô ấy cảm thấy không đúng. Cô không nghĩ thay đổi nhân sự sẽ tạo ra khác biệt lớn. Cô có thể tưởng tượng những vấn đề tương tự sẽ quay lại, bất kể ai tham gia.

**Giải pháp thông minh:**

**Với sếp (đáp ứng narrative):**

> "Chúng tôi đang triển khai những practices giúp rủi ro hiện ra sớm hơn và các commitment đáng tin cậy hơn. Tôi sẽ tự chịu trách nhiệm bằng cách check-in những số liệu này mỗi 2 tuần."

**Với team (thay đổi thực chất):**

- Tạo ngôn ngữ chung giúp an toàn khi báo cáo rủi ro sớm
- Khám phá các động lực ẩn khiến engineers làm quá tải

---

### **🎯 BÀI HỌC QUAN TRỌNG:**

**Cách tiếp cận hiệu quả:**

1. **Không đối đầu trực tiếp** với narrative của sếp
2. **Đồng tác giả** một câu chuyện tốt hơn
3. **Đáp ứng nhu cầu narrative** trong khi **tạo không gian thử nghiệm** những practices phức tạp hơn

**Kết quả đạt được:**

- Sếp có câu chuyện họ có thể ủng hộ ("team đang xây dựng habits mạnh mẽ hơn cho predictability")
- Team có không gian thử nghiệm những practices nhận thức về complexity

---

### **🧠 INSIGHT CHO TECH LEADERS:**

**Vấn đề phổ biến:**
Nhiều người hiểu về systems thinking bị sa lầm vào việc "bán" complexity, uncertainty, systems thinking. Trong khi đó, hầu hết mọi người trong tổ chức đang tìm **giải pháp và con đường tiến**, không phải bài giảng về "hệ thống".

**Họ muốn:**

- Là đồng tác giả của giải pháp và narrative
- Biết "chúng ta CÓ THỂ làm gì?"
- Hiểu "tại sao đây là lựa chọn đúng?"
- Có câu chuyện đằng sau quyết định

**Bài học cho bạn:**
Thay vì chỉ chỉ ra vấn đề phức tạp, hãy **đồng tạo ra narrative** mà mọi người có thể tin tưởng và thực hiện!

Bài này rất hay cho leadership skills! Bạn có muốn thảo luận thêm về cách áp dụng không? 🤔
